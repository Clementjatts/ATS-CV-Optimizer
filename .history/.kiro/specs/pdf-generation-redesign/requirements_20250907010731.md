# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current 'Save as PDF' feature in the ATS CV Optimizer application suffers from significant formatting issues, inconsistent output quality, and reliability problems. Users report that generated PDFs have layout distortions, missing content, poor font rendering, and compatibility issues with various PDF viewers and ATS systems.
