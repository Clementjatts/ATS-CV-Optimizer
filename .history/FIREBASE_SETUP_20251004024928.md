# Firebase Setup Guide for ATS CV Optimizer

## 1. Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Create a project" or "Add project"
3. Enter your project name (e.g., "ats-cv-optimizer")
4. Choose whether to enable Google Analytics (optional)
5. Click "Create project"

## 2. Enable Firestore Database

1. In your Firebase project, go to "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose "Start in test mode" for development (you can secure it later)
4. Select a location for your database (choose the closest to your users)
5. Click "Done"

## 3. Get Firebase Configuration

1. In your Firebase project, click the gear icon (⚙️) next to "Project Overview"
2. Select "Project settings"
3. Scroll down to "Your apps" section
4. Click the web icon (</>) to add a web app
5. Enter an app nickname (e.g., "ATS CV Optimizer Web")
6. Click "Register app"
7. Copy the Firebase configuration object

## 4. Update Firebase Configuration

Replace the placeholder values in `firebaseConfig.ts` with your actual Firebase configuration:

```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-actual-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-actual-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-actual-sender-id",
  appId: "your-actual-app-id"
};
```

## 5. Set Up Firestore Security Rules (Optional)

For development, you can use test mode. For production, update your Firestore rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read/write access to saved_cvs collection
    match /saved_cvs/{document} {
      allow read, write: if true; // For development only
    }
  }
}
```

## 6. Database Schema

The application will automatically create the following collections:

### `saved_cvs` Collection
Each document contains:
- `name`: string - Display name for the CV
- `content`: string - JSON stringified CV data
- `jobTitle`: string (optional) - Job title associated with the CV
- `company`: string (optional) - Company name
- `industry`: string (optional) - Industry sector
- `skills`: array of strings - Skills extracted from the CV
- `experience`: array of strings - Job titles from work experience
- `education`: array of strings - Educational institutions
- `tags`: array of strings - User-defined tags
- `description`: string (optional) - Description of the CV
- `createdAt`: timestamp - When the CV was saved
- `updatedAt`: timestamp - When the CV was last modified

## 7. Features Enabled

With Firebase integration, you can now:

### Save CVs

- See when each CV was last updated

## 8. Usage Tips

1. **Save Successful CVs**: After optimizing a CV, click "Save to Database" to store it for future use

3. **Add Tags**: Use tags to categorize CVs by skills, industries, or job types
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Periodically review and delete outdated CVs to keep your database organized

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Firebase not initialized**: Check that your Firebase configuration is correct
- **Permission denied**: Ensure Firestore rules allow read/write access
- **Network errors**: Check your internet connection and Firebase project status

### Development vs Production:
- **Development**: Use test mode for easy setup
- **Production**: Implement proper authentication and security rules

## 10. Next Steps
