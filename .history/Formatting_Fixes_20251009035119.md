# **Advanced PDF Page Break and Spacing Control**

This document provides a refined solution to create more natural, "flowing" page breaks within the Professional Experience section, eliminating the large white gaps.

### **The Problem: "Block" vs. "Flowing" Page Breaks**

You've correctly identified that there's too much white space when a job experience section is near the bottom of a page. This is because the current CSS (break-inside: avoid;) is applied to the entire container for a single job experience. This tells the PDF generator: "**Never split this entire job block.**" If the whole block doesn't fit, it gets pushed to the next page, leaving a gap.

The behavior you want (like in the Skills section) is a more nuanced, "flowing" break. This can be achieved by telling the generator which specific lines to keep whole, while allowing the container itself to break *between* those lines.

### **The Solution: Granular Page Break Control**

The fix is to move the .break-inside-avoid class from the parent container of each job to the smaller, individual elements *inside* it. This gives the rendering engine the flexibility to fill the page with as many bullet points as possible before creating a page break.

**1\. Update components/CVManager.tsx**

Modify the map function that renders your professionalExperience array. You will **remove** break-inside-avoid from the main div and **add** it to the headings and each list item (li).

// In components/CVManager.tsx

// Inside the .map() for your professionalExperience array  
\<div key={index} className="mb-4"\> {/\* \<-- REMOVE 'break-inside-avoid' from this parent div \*/}  
    
  {/\* Flex container for the main heading \*/}  
  \<div className="flex justify-between items-baseline break-inside-avoid"\> {/\* ADD class here \*/}  
    \<h3 className="font-bold text-lg"\>{exp.title}\</h3\>  
    \<p className="text-sm text-gray-600 font-medium"\>{exp.date}\</p\>  
  \</div\>  
    
  {/\* Sub-heading for the company \*/}  
  \<p className="italic text-md text-gray-800 break-inside-avoid"\>{exp.company}\</p\> {/\* ADD class here \*/}

  {/\* Responsibilities list \*/}  
  \<ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-sm"\>  
    {exp.responsibilities.map((res, i) \=\> (  
      // By adding the class to each \<li\>, you allow breaks BETWEEN bullet points  
      // but not IN THE MIDDLE of a single bullet point.  
      \<li key={i} className="mb-1 break-inside-avoid"\>{res}\</li\> {/\* ADD class here \*/}  
    ))}  
  \</ul\>  
\</div\>

**2\. Ensure the CSS Class Exists**

Make sure this class is still present in your index.css file. If it's already there from the previous suggestion, no changes are needed.

/\* In index.css \*/  
.break-inside-avoid {  
  break-inside: avoid;  
  page-break-inside: avoid; /\* Legacy property for broader compatibility \*/  
}

By making this change, the PDF generator will be able to create a page break right after a bullet point if needed, which will fill up the white space and create the seamless flow you're looking for.
