# **Final PDF Page Break Solution: A JavaScript-Based Approach**

After reviewing the latest PDF, it's clear that CSS alone isn't solving the page-break issue. The html2pdf.js library is still prioritizing keeping the entire "experience" section together, leading to large gaps.

The most robust solution is to control the page-breaking behavior directly through the library's JavaScript configuration. This gives us more precise control than CSS classes alone.

### **The Problem: CSS Rules Are Being Ignored**

Even with granular break-inside: avoid classes, the library's rendering logic is still treating the entire div containing a job role as a single, atomic unit. When this unit doesn't fit at the bottom of a page, the whole thing is moved, leaving a gap.

### **The Solution: Configure html2pdf.js Directly**

We will use the pagebreak option within the html2pdf.js configuration object. This directly tells the engine how to handle page breaks.

**1\. Update the handlePrint function in App.tsx**

You are currently calling html2pdf() in a simple way. We need to expand this to include a configuration object. This change directly targets the library's behavior for a more reliable fix.

// In App.tsx

const handlePrint \= () \=\> {  
  const element \= document.getElementById('cv-content');  
  if (element) {  
    const opt \= {  
      margin: \[10, 10, 10, 10\],  
      filename: 'cv\_document.pdf',  
      image: { type: 'jpeg', quality: 0.98 },  
      html2canvas: { scale: 2, useCORS: true },  
      jsPDF: { unit: 'mm', format: 'a4', orientation: 'portrait' },  
        
      // THIS IS THE CRUCIAL NEW PART  
      // It tells html2pdf to avoid breaking inside these specific HTML elements.  
      pagebreak: {   
        mode: \['css', 'avoid-all'\],   
        avoid: \['h3', 'p', 'li'\]   
      }  
    };

    html2pdf().from(element).set(opt).save();  
  }  
};

**What this new code does:**

* mode: \['css', 'avoid-all'\]: This tells the library to first respect any CSS break rules it finds, and then apply its own logic to prevent breaks inside elements.  
* avoid: \['h3', 'p', 'li'\]: This is a direct command to the PDF generator: **"You are allowed to create a page break *between* these elements, but you must not split one in half."** This will prevent a single bullet point or heading from being cut across two pages, forcing the break to happen in the space between lines, which is exactly the "flowing" behavior you want.

**2\. Clean Up CVManager.tsx (Recommended)**

Since the JavaScript configuration is now handling the page breaks, you can **remove all instances of the break-inside-avoid className** from your CVManager.tsx file. This will make your code cleaner and prevent any potential conflicts.

The experience section rendering should look like this again:

// In components/CVManager.tsx

\<div key={index} className="mb-4"\> {/\* No break class needed here \*/}  
  \<div className="flex justify-between items-baseline"\> {/\* No break class needed here \*/}  
    \<h3 className="font-bold text-lg"\>{exp.title}\</h3\>  
    \<p className="text-sm text-gray-600 font-medium"\>{exp.date}\</p\>  
  \</div\>  
  \<p className="italic text-md text-gray-800"\>{exp.company}\</p\> {/\* No break class needed here \*/}  
  \<ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-sm"\>  
    {exp.responsibilities.map((res, i) \=\> (  
      \<li key={i} className="mb-1"\>{res}\</li\> {/\* No break class needed here \*/}  
    ))}  
  \</ul\>  
\</div\>

This JavaScript-based approach is far more reliable for controlling html2pdf.js and should finally resolve the stubborn page-breaking issue.
