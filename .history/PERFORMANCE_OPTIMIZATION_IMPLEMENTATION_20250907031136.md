## Integration with Existing System

### PDF Controller Integration

The performance optimization has been integrated into the main `PDFGenerationController`:

```typescript
// Performance optimization integration
await this.performanceOptimizer.lazyLoadDependencies(strategy);
const optimization = this.performanceOptimizer.optimizeConfiguration(element, config);
const result = await this.performanceOptimizer.profileGeneration(element, config, generationFn);
this.performanceMonitor.trackGeneration(strategy, config, result, element, startTime);
```

### Modern PDF Generator Integration

The `ModernPDFGenerator` now includes caching capabilities:

```typescript
// Font and image caching
const fontLoadResult = await this.loadFontsWithCache(detectedFonts);
const optimizedImages = await this.processImagesWithCache(element, imageProcessingOptions);
```

## Performance Improvements
