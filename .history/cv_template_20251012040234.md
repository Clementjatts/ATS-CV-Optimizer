Having reviewed the code for the ClassicTemplate.tsx, CreativeTemplate.tsx, and MinimalTemplate.tsx files, within the "Professional Experience" section, you are mapping over your work experience items. The container for each individual job—the div that has the job title, company, dates, and description—has a style applied to it that says break-inside: avoid. You are telling the PDF generator that each job entry is an unbreakable block. This is why when the third job is too long to fit completely on the first page, the entire block is forced onto the next page, leaving the empty space you're seeing.

Excellent question. Yes, there is a better and more professional option that offers a middle ground between "never break a section" and "break anywhere." My previous recommendation was the simplest way to solve the "big white gap" problem, but a more refined approach will give you a much better-looking document.

This better option involves using a combination of CSS page-break properties to control the flow more intelligently. Instead of treating each job experience as a single, unbreakable block, you allow it to break, but you add specific rules to prevent awkward breaks, such as a heading being left alone at the bottom of a page or a single line of text being stranded on the next page. This strategy is how professional layout software handles text flow.

Here’s the breakdown of this more advanced strategy:

First, as I recommended before, you need to remove the break-inside: avoid; from the main container of each job experience. This is the crucial first step that allows the content inside to flow across pages.

Second, you should apply break-after: avoid; specifically to the headings within each job section (like the job title and company name). This rule ensures that a heading is never left stranded at the bottom of a page with its content starting on the next page. The heading will always stick with the paragraph that follows it.

Third, and this is the most professional touch, you should control for "widows" and "orphans." An "orphan" is the first line of a paragraph that gets left behind at the bottom of a page. A "widow" is the last line of a paragraph that ends up all alone at the top of a new page. Both are considered typographically poor and interrupt the reader's flow. You can prevent this by applying the orphans and widows properties to your paragraph tags. A value of 2 or 3 is standard, which tells the PDF generator that at least two or three lines of a paragraph must be kept together at the beginning or end of a page.

By combining these three techniques, you get the best of both worlds: your pages will be filled with content, eliminating the large gaps, but the breaks will happen in a clean and logical way that maintains a professional and easy-to-read layout.
