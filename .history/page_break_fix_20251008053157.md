# **Fixing Incorrect Page Breaks in PDF Generation**

## **1\. The Problem**

When generating a PDF from the job seeker's CV data, the content is abruptly cut off at the end of a page and continues on the next, often splitting lines of text in half. This happens because the PDF generation library (html2pdf.js) is not automatically calculating where to make a clean break in the content.

For instance, in the job seeker.pdf, the "Professional Experience" section for "Maldini Security" is cut off mid-sentence.

## **2\. The Root Cause**

The core issue lies in how html2pdf.js handles automatic page breaks. By default, it may not be able to intelligently determine the best place to break the content, especially within complex React components. It essentially takes a "screenshot" of the HTML content and splits it into pages, which can lead to awkward cuts.

Looking at your App.tsx file, the PDF is generated from the \#cv-container element. The library needs explicit instructions on how to handle page breaks for the children inside this container.

## **3\. The Solution: CSS Control**

The most effective way to control page breaks with html2pdf.js is to use CSS properties that define how elements should behave when they encounter a page break. We can instruct it to avoid breaking *inside* an element and to break *before* or *after* specific elements.

Here are the specific changes needed in your index.css file:

### **Step-by-Step Code Changes**

1. **Open index.css:** This is where we'll add the styles to control printing and PDF generation.  
2. Add Styles for Page Break Control:  
   Add the following CSS rules. These tell the PDF generator to avoid breaking inside the main sections of your CV.  
   /\* Add this to your index.css \*/

   /\* Ensure that the main sections of the CV are not split across pages \*/  
   .cv-section {  
       page-break-inside: avoid;  
   }

   /\* It's also a good idea to avoid breaking inside individual job/education entries \*/  
   .job-entry, .education-entry {  
       page-break-inside: avoid;  
   }

   /\* You can also force a break before a major new section if needed,  
      but 'avoid' is usually sufficient. \*/  
   h2, h3 {  
      /\* Give some space before a new heading after a page break \*/  
       padding-top: 1rem;  
       /\* Try to keep headings with the content that follows them \*/  
       page-break-after: avoid;  
   }
