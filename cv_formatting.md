# **Permanent Solutions for CV Formatting and PDF Generation**

Here are the detailed solutions to fix the PDF content truncation, CSS alignment issues, and awkward page breaks in your CV application.

## **1\. Issue: PDF Content is Cut Off and Incomplete**

**Problem:** The generated PDF is incomplete, missing the last two sections ("PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATIONS" and "KEY SKILLS & COMPETENCIES").

**Root Cause:** The html2pdf.js library can miscalculate the total height of dynamically rendered content, causing it to truncate the output.

### **Permanent Solution**

Adjust the handleDownloadPdf function in App.tsx with a more robust configuration.

#### **Step-by-Step Code Changes in App.tsx:**

1. **Locate the handleDownloadPdf function** in your App.tsx file.  
2. **Update the html2pdf options** as shown below:

const handleDownloadPdf \= () \=\> {  
    const cvElement \= document.getElementById('cv-container');  
    if (cvElement) {  
        const options \= {  
            margin: \[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5\], // inches  
            filename: 'Clement\_Adegnenro\_CV.pdf',  
            image: { type: 'jpeg', quality: 0.98 },  
            html2canvas: {  
                scale: 2,  
                useCORS: true,  
                logging: true,  
                letterRendering: true,  
            },  
            jsPDF: {  
                unit: 'in',  
                format: 'a4',  
                orientation: 'portrait'  
            },  
            // This pagebreak configuration offers better control  
            pagebreak: { mode: \['css', 'avoid-all'\] }  
        };

        html2pdf().from(cvElement).set(options).save();  
    }  
};

**Why this works:** The pagebreak: { mode: \['css', 'avoid-all'\] } option improves the library's ability to handle content that flows across multiple pages, preventing it from stopping before the document is fully rendered.

## **2\. Issue: CSS Content Alignment is Incorrect**

**Problem:** Elements that should be on the same line (e.g., Job Title and Date) are being pushed onto separate lines.

**Root Cause:** The parent flexbox container is allowing its children to wrap when the container width is constrained.

### **Permanent Solution**

Explicitly tell the flex containers not to wrap their children by using Tailwind's flex-nowrap utility class.

#### **Step-by-Step Code Changes in App.tsx:**

1. **Go through your JSX in App.tsx**.  
2. **Find every div that uses flex justify-between** for alignment.  
3. **Add the flex-nowrap class** to these divs.

{/\* Example for the Professional Experience section \*/}  
\<div className="flex justify-between items-center flex-nowrap"\>  
  \<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold"\>{exp.title}\</h3\>  
  \<p className="text-sm text-right"\>{exp.duration}\</p\>  
\</div\>

**Apply this flex-nowrap class to:**

* Each professional experience header.  
* Each education header.  
* Any other element where you have left- and right-aligned content on the same line.

## **3\. Issue: Awkward Gaps and Unwanted Page Breaks in PDF**

**Problem:** The generated PDF has large empty spaces. For example, after the "PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY," there is a large gap, and the "PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE" section is pushed to a new page, even though there is plenty of space left on the first page.

**Root Cause:** This is caused by the page-break-inside: avoid; CSS rule being applied to a very large container (like the entire "PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE" section). If the entire section doesn't fit on the current page, the rule forces the *whole thing* to jump to the next page, leaving the gap.

### **Permanent Solution**

We need to be more precise with our page-break rules. Instead of keeping the entire section together, we will only keep individual job entries from breaking.

#### **Step-by-Step Code Changes in index.css:**

1. **Open index.css**.  
2. **Replace your old page-break CSS** with this more refined version. This version removes the rule from the main section and applies it only to smaller, more logical blocks of content.

/\*  
 \* Replace your previous page-break rules with this in index.css  
 \*/

/\*  
 \* This is the key change: We NO LONGER avoid breaks inside an entire section.  
 \* This will prevent large empty gaps.  
 \*/  
.cv-section {  
    /\* No page-break-inside rule here anymore\! \*/  
}

/\*  
 \* INSTEAD, we only prevent individual items (like a single job or school)  
 \* from being split across two pages. This is much more flexible.  
 \*/  
.job-entry, .education-entry {  
    page-break-inside: avoid;  
}

/\*  
 \* This rule prevents a section title (like "PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE")  
 \* from being left alone at the bottom of a page. It encourages the break  
 \* to happen BEFORE the title.  
 \*/  
h2 {  
   page-break-before: auto; /\* Default, but good to be explicit \*/  
   page-break-after: avoid;  
}

**Why this works:** This approach provides the PDF generator with smarter, more granular instructions. It allows long lists of items (like your job history) to flow naturally across pages but ensures that no single job description or heading is awkwardly split in two. This eliminates the large white gaps while keeping the document readable.
